        MyVPN is a lightweight browser VPN solution powered by a custom Chrome
        Extension and a secure SOCKS5 proxy server hosted on the cloud. Users
        can connect to a secure Singapore server with one click. Unlike
        traditional VPNs, we verify users through token-based authentication to
        keep it simple, fast, and powerful.
